## üéØ Challenges & Learnings

### üöß Challenges

- **Watchmode API Integration**:
  Some endpoints required trial-and-error to parse responses correctly.
- **Concurrent API Calls**:
  Implemented `Publishers.zip` to combine multiple API requests (e.g., fetching movies and shows at once).
- **Testing**:
  Mocking API responses for reliable unit tests.

### üìö Learnings

- Improved proficiency in SwiftUI and Combine.
- Gained experience with reactive data pipelines.
- Learned to structure scalable network layers.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- **Enhanced UI/UX**:
  Add custom animations, better grids, and dark mode support.
- **Backend Optimization**:
  Implement caching for faster load times and reduce API calls.
- **New Features**:
  - User accounts with favorites/watchlists.
  - Trailers and reviews section.
  - Pagination for infinite scrolling.
- **Expanded Testing**:
  Add UI tests and improve test coverage.
- **Search Functionality**:
  Add UI tests and improve test coverage.
